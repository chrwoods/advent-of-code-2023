Written nearly 100% alone other than 4 minor hints -- 25/25 days completed! Tried to do it at midnight when I had the chance, only got 20 global points though.

Hints:
- Day 12: i forgot that `lru_cache` exists and it sped up my code from 16 hours to 6 seconds
- Day 17: top left doesn't count as movement, so you need to do at least 4 excluding, not including
- Day 20: "just draw out the circuitry"
- Day 21: "please actually look at the real input instead of the sample input, it's a lot simpler than you think"

Next year I'll hopefully draft an actual template library with stuff like A* and automatic cycle detection so I don't have to write that manually every time.

Final Rankings:
```
You have 20 points.
